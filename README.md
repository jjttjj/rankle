# Rankle - Rank in Clojure

**Alpha** This repository currently represents a set of code spikes and thought
experiments.

* Array programming and rank-oriented functions are inspired by [J](http://www.jsoftware.com/).
* The column map and table abstractions are inspired by [Q](http://code.kx.com/q/).

Start by reading this repo's [Rankle](Rankle.ipynb) document.
